        <p> I'm a student web developer with a passion for creation and a believer in success through determination. I currently reside in Concord, California beside beautiful Mt. Diablo. </p>
          
           <p> As a practicing Registered Dental Assistant, I meet with patients personally to discuss their needs and relay this information directly to their doctor, aiding in diagnosing the issue at hand. By translating these skills to programming, I'm able to: </p> <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Listen to others and analyze the needs of the project</li>
              <li>Work as a team to tackle and diagnose bugs in the code</li>
              <li>Bridge technical skill with the human element to provide a personable, and reliable approach to any task</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> Life has taken me everywhere: from molecular biology student at UC Berkeley to restaurant baker and part-time Magic: the Gathering streamer, and finally to my current position as RDA in a small dental office. Always quick to adapt, I've grown to enjoy the unique challenges and ever-changing approaches that programming provides. </p> 
              <div>
              As a student at Thinkful, I'm looking forward to putting my life experience and determination to the test. We've only scratched the surface, and there is a whole world out there to discover and build upon. I'm always looking to learn and provide a helping hand where possible. If that interests you, let's build together.
